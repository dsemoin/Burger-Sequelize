# Burger-Sequelize
Burger app using Sequelize

Burger logger using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and Sequelize.
This is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. 
Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
The app was created using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and Sequelize. 
I followed the MVC design pattern by using Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.
The app is deployed on Heroku
I will maintain the app and answer any questions relating to it.
